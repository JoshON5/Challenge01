# Horiseon Social Media Website code refractoring

## Description
This website was refractored to have a more streamlined HTML for collaborations and also include more accesibility code for the website. This was done by including alt text for the image elements and a title for the website. The goal of this website was to deliver a concise building block of HTML for the USER to build upon and create more dynamic features without cluttered code.
